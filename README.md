## Topic
**Features and Formality**

My project calculates the formality score of multiple bilingual conversations using the part-of-speech features present in the utterances. It will look at whether there are any notable differences between conversations between co-workers versus conversations between family members when it comes to calculated formality. It will also investigate if there is a correlation with code-switch frequency. A future continuation to this project is to train a binary classifer model using POS tags (either formal or informal) as features and their frequency as weights.
